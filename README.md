# MemeMeMyVersion
My version of Udacity iOS "UIKit-Fundamentals" final class project
MemMe..MyVersion. App to create a Meme (text over a picture). Provides functionality to take a picture using device
camera (if available) or select from photos lib.
Created as a refresher to coarse content. Meets course ribric with a couple exceptions where I took a little "creative" license.
